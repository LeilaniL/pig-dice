## Description

A webpage which lets two players play a game of pig dice, rolling dice until someone reaches a total score of 50. On their turn, a player can choose to keep rolling and adding to their total, or click hold and play passes to the next player. If the player doesn't click hold and rolls a 1, their current turn's score will reset to zero and their turn will be over.
