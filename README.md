# Pig Dice

#### Two-player pig dice game

## Description

Lets two players roll dice, choose when to hold, and outscore each other. A player has unlimited rolls on their turn, but if they roll 1, their total score for that turn resets to zero.

This was a two-day project the week we learned about objects and constructors.
